# Command matcher

A basic struct for using a trait to define behaviour for defining and commands. The main point of this was to create a plug & play method of registerings commands. The idea behind this was to be able to enable/disable commands during runtime.

## Examples?

I'm lazy so please take a look at `src/main.rs`

## No license?

Nah, as you can probably guess I haven't put much effort into this. You don't need my permission to use this code (except in the case you are using this as training data in ML).
